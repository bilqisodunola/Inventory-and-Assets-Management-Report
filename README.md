# Inventory-and-Assets-Management-Report
The Power BI Inventory and Assets Report provides a structured overview of asset distribution, status, and financial impact to support data-driven decision-making. It aims to help the organization and management track assets, monitor depreciation, identify items nearing warranty expiration, and optimize resource allocation for improved efficiency.
The report includes key insights derived from data transformation, analysis, and visualization.

#  Key Highlights:

# Asset Distribution & Status:
I categorized assets based on type, location, and department.
Identified assets as Active, In Use, Under Maintenance, and Inactive.
Highlighted which asset categories had the highest number of items.

# Depreciation & Warranty Tracking:
I created a new column for the depreciation values based on the years owned.
A custom column to identify assets nearing warranty expiration to plan for replacements or renewals.

# Trends & Forecasting:
A line chart to visualize trends in asset acquisition over time.
Identified peak purchase periods and projected future asset needs.

# Interactive Dashboard & Decision Making:
